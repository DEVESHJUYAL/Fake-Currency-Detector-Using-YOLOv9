# Fake Currency Detection using YOLOv9

This project aims to detect fake Rs 500 currency notes using the YOLOv9 algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of both real and fake Rs 500 notes. The final solution is deployed as a web application using Flask API, allowing users to upload images and receive detection results in real time.

## Features

- Real-time Detection: Uses YOLOv9 for efficient and accurate detection of fake currency notes.

- Web Interface: A simple and user-friendly web application for uploading images and displaying results.

- Flask API Integration: The backend is powered by Flask, handling image uploads and running the detection model.

- Python Implementation: Core functionalities and model training are implemented in Python.
